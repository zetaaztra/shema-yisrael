Psalm 121
I lift up my eyes to the mountains;
What is the source of my help?
My help comes from Adonai,
Maker of heaven and earth.
God will not let your foot give way;
your Guardian will not slumber.
Behold! The Guardian of Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps!
Adonai in your Guardian,
God is your protection at your right hand.
The sun will not strike you by day nor the moon by night.
Adonai will guard you from all harm--
Adonai will guard your soul,
your going and your coming,
now and for ever.

Shema. Hear, O Israel: 
Adonai is our God
Adonai in One! Blessed is God's name; 
His glorious kingdom is for ever and ever!
And you shall love Adonai your God with 
all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might
